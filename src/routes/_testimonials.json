Now, I can practice identifying rocks and birds whenever I want. SciOlyID has improved my and my team's skills tremendously in Rocks and Minerals, Fossils, and Ornithology through the 2020, 2021, and 2022 seasons. Thank you for creating this excellent resource for the Science Olympiad ID event community."

I can pop in during a team member's practice session and give them tips on the specific birds they miss. It's saved all the time I'd normally spend creating a flashcard set; now I can spend even more time honing my ID skills."

Without SciOlyID, the process of learning, exploring, and familiarizing myself with the various ID event lists would be much more tedious. It gamifies the monotonous process of learning all the specimens and makes it fun. I would highly recommend it to anyone who participates in identification events."
