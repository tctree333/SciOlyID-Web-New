# SciOlyID's Privacy Policy

**Effective: April 23, 2020**

By using SciOlyID bots or services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

### User Personal Information

_User Personal Information_ is any personal information that could be used to personally identify a user. Personal information we use include Discord usernames/discriminators, Discord nicknames, and Discord user ids. This information will only be used to provide functionality to the bot, such as saving user scores, saving session data, or mentioning a user.

### Server Information

_Server Information_ is any information relating to a Discord server the bot is in. Server information we use includes server ids, server roles, channel ids, and channel names. Private DM channels with the bot are also included within _Server Information_. This information will only be used to provide functionality to the bot, such as saving racing data or saving leaderboards.

### Other Information

_Other Information_ is any information we collect that is not directly linked to a specific user or server. Other information we use include message content, timestamps, user roles, or other activity. This information will only be used to provide functionality to the bot.

_User Personal Information_, _Server Information_, and _Other Information_ may be stored in a database to save user progress. This information may also be logged to find issues or other problems with the bot.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect or use any more data than is absolutely necessary for the bot to function. We will not view message information not prefixed with the bot's command prefix.

## Information We Share/Access

We will not share or sell any _User Personal Information_, _Server Information_, or _Other Information_ to third parties unrelated to bot functionality without your permission. We do not host advertisements with this bot, but we may link to outside third parties, such as Wikipedia, to provide more information on birds. We may access _User Personal Information_, _Server Information_, or _Other Information_ through log data or by viewing the database to identify issues or problems with the bot. Aggregated data, such as the number of active users, number of servers, or number of channels the bot can see will be used to display statistics about bot usage.

Your Discord username/discriminator, nickname, or id may be shown and associated with a score for display purposes, such as for score leaderboards.

## Your Control Over Your Data

Generally, we will retain _User Personal Information_, _Server Information_, or _Other Information_ only for as long as it is needed to provide bot functionality. For example, session and race data will be deleted from the database after the session or race has ended, and data about the requested bird in a channel is cleared when a new bird is requested. Raw log data will be retained for no more than 8 days, while error monitoring data will be retained for no more than 31 days.

If you wish to have your data deleted, please contact us through the [Discord support server][server link]. Please understand that by deleting your data, existing scores will be cleared. Note that if you use the bot after deletion of data, new data will be generated. After a request for your data to be deleted, we will delete your user data from the database within 30 days and log/error data containing your data will be automatically cleared after 30 days. Note that server or channel data cannot be deleted without the permission of every user whose data could be affected.

## Data Security

We take many appropriate security measures to secure your data. Transmission of user data from Discord is encrypted using HTTPS and SSL/TLS and access to user data is restricted to authorized individuals. Note that no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee your information's absolute security. If you do discover any security issues, please report them through the [Discord support server][server link].

## Changes

We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be announced at least 14 days prior to the change taking effect though the [Discord support server][server link].

## Contact

Any questions, concerns, or comments regarding this Privacy Policy can be asked in the [Discord support server][server link].
