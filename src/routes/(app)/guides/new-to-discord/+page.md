# New to Discord?

[Back to all guides](/guides/)

_This guide is meant for people who are new to Discord and SciOlyID. Users who have used Discord before can skip this guide and go to ["Getting Started"](/guides/getting-started/)._

If you're not familiar, [Discord](https://discord.com/) is a communication platform for communities that supports text, voice, and video. Communities can be small, such as a couple of friends, or large, with hundreds of thousands of members worldwide.

Check out [Discord's support page on getting started](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started) to learn how to create an account. Once you're there, you can join our [support server](/server/) and start using SciOlyID!

## Discord bots

Discord bots are automated non-user accounts that can provide different services from within Discord. Moderation bots keep things clean, fun bots provide minigames, and music bots play music. SciOlyID offers two bots: **Bird-ID** for Ornithology and **Minerobo** for Rocks and Minerals.

Usually, Discord bots define a set of commands starting with a bot's prefix. The prefix prevents commands from colliding with each other or messages sent by users.

## Terminology reference

For a more detailed explanation, check out the [Beginner's Guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord). The most important terms are outlined below for reference.

- **Server** (sometimes called guilds): A community of people centered around a common interest. Servers show up on the left-hand side in your Discord client.
- **Channels**: A space to talk, usually about some sub-topic within the server. Channels keep conversations organized. Text channels are denoted with the # symbol.
- **Voice Channel** (sometimes shortened to VC): A channel for communicating over audio or video. These are denoted with an audio symbol.
- **Discord bot**: A non-user account.
- **Command**: A message that a bot will respond to.
- **Bot prefix**: A string of characters that identifies a command for that bot.

Now that you're familiar with Discord, let's get started with SciOlyID!
